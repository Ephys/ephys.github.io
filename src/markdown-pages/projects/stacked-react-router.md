Stacked React Router is a library built on top of React Router. 
It provides tools to replicate the kind of routing you would find in native applications:

- Directional page transition (transition goes backwards if going back in the history).
- A built-in back button.
- APIs to handle complex operations on the browser history (such as removing a multi-page flow from the history).
