 It is my opinion that one of the biggest pain point when joining a project is filling in the configuration files of the project as they're often very cryptic and/or provide little to no information on what is needed.

This work in progress library is an attempt to solve that issue by letting the application declare exactly what it needs, using [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi).
