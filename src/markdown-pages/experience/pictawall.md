Pictawall was a SaaS platform that provided dynamic displays for User Generated Content to events and websites.

During my time at Pictawall, I worked on implementing and optimizing the website integration of the platform.  
It had to provide numerous different layouts and be highly flexible and configurable, while still loading extremely fast.

It was an extremely fun experience which allowed me to research and apply new techniques for optimization and modularization.
