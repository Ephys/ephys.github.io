      <p>Hi I'm Guylian!</p>

      <p>I'm a deeply passionate developer who continuously strives to be better at both who I am and what I'm
        doing.</p>

      <p>I want to make the world wide web fast, and accessible to people of all backgrounds.
        I really enjoy finding clever, automatic, optimizations to make my apps faster (babel is such a great tool for
        that)!</p>

      <p>Currently, my language of predilection is JavaScript/ECMAScript. I am also very enthusiast about other
        web technologies such as the DOM, HTML, CSS and the gazillion of other specs.</p>

      <p>I try to keep up to date (and sometimes a bit in advance) with the tech of our industry by actively reading
        (and writing too!) the TC39 (ECMAScript), WHATWG (HTML), and W3C (CSS) githubs and mailing lists (ECMAScript).
        I love the open source community and <a href="https://github.com/Ephys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try to give back when I can</a>.</p>

      <p>
        I've worked with community-produced tech such as React, Webpack, SCSS, PostCSS, Babel, Gatsby, PHP, Wordpress,
        PostgreSQL, MySQL
        (others too but they're not as used anymore).

        <p>
          Pictawall was a SaaS platform that provided dynamic displays for User Generated Content to events and
          websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at Pictawall, I worked on implementing and optimizing the website integration of the
          platform.<br />
          It had to provide numerous different layouts and be highly flexible and configurable, while still loading
          extremely fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an extremely fun experience which allowed me to research and apply new techniques for optimization and
          modularization.

        <h3>Joi Config Generator</h3>
        <span class="time"><time>2018</time></span>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/madkingsag/joi-config-generator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Source code</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi-config-generator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">npm</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It is my opinion that one of the biggest pain point when joining a project is filling in the configuration files of the project as they're often very cryptic and/or provide little to no information on what is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This (<strong>WIP</strong>!) library is an attempt to solve that issue by letting the application declare exactly what it needs, using <a href="https://github.com/hapijs/joi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joi</a>.

        </ul>

        <p>
          I wanted to add support for dotenv files in joi-config-generator, and wanted to learn how to parse non-trivial file formats. So I wrote a na√Øve parser!

        </ul>

        <p>
          My biggest issue with <a href="https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">react-intl</a> was how complex it is to insert tags in one of their formatted message. Especially when they become nested.
          <br/>
          To solve this issue, I wrote a library that replaces XML tags, found inside the formatted message, with React components or elements.
          <br/>
          It does so before any user variable is injected into the formatted message, to avoid XSS.

        <p>
          The gender unicorn is a website created for the <a href="http://www.transstudent.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><abbr title="Trans Student Educational Resources">TSER</abbr></a>.
          It is a recreation of their <a href="http://www.transstudent.org/gender" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gender Unicorn infographic</a> as an interactive, mobile friendly version.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was incredibly fun, and a great opportunity to learn how to adapt a design for a different medium, while staying true to the original.
