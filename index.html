				<h3>Hello there!</h3>

				<p>I'm <em>Guylian Cox</em> and I'm a 20-year-old currently studying Computer Science at <a href="http://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ipl/Pages/Informatique-de-gestion.aspx" target="_blank">Institut Paul-Lambin</a> in Brussels.
				   I'm mostly self-taught and, while classes are doing wonders at sharpening my algorithmic skills, my knowledge of web-related technologies comes primarily from online documentations such as the
					<abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDP</abbr> (and Stack Overflow).
				</p>
				<p>I've grown a passion for web development since I was 16, I loved from the beginning that this domain keeps evolving and keeping me interested.<br>
					Starting off with <em>PHP5</em> for a few years
				   along with the mandatory web languages that are <em>HTML5</em>, <em>CSS3</em> and its preprocessors (<em>LESS</em> at first, followed by <em>SCSS</em>).
				</p>
				<p>I then started learning <em>Javascript</em> and, with the advent of <em>NodeJS</em>, started getting more interested in the back-end than the front-end.</p>
				<p>I tend to prefer stricter working environment, one of the reasons I also like <em>Java</em> and would like to explore C# and .NET, <em>Typescript</em> felt like a blessing when I discovered it.</p>

				<p>Tinkers' Steelworks is a
					<a href="http://minecraftforge.net" target="_blank">MinecraftForge</a> mod I forked mid-2014 when its original author, known as
					<a href="https://github.com/Toops/" target="_blank">toops</a>, stopped working on it. You can find the original version
					<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1445710-1-6-4-tinkers-steelworks" target="_blank">here</a>
				</p>

				<p>At first I picked it up to port it to Minecraft 1.7.10 but it quickly became a playground with which I put the Java concepts I was studying at my school into practice. My work on that project however, was mainly focused on fixing bugs, improving existing features and creating an API to support the interactions with other game modifications.<br> On a personal level this project helped me improved my understanding of Java, along with the discovery of gradle and maven.</p>
