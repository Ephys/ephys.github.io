      <p>Hi I'm Guylian!</p>

      <p>I'm a deeply passionate developer who continuously strives to be better at both who I am and what I'm
        doing.</p>

      <p>I want to make the world wide web fast, and accessible to people of all backgrounds.
        I really enjoy finding clever, automatic, optimizations to make my apps faster (babel is such a great tool for
        that)!</p>

      <p>Currently, my language of predilection is JavaScript/ECMAScript. I am also very enthusiast about other
        web technologies such as the DOM, HTML, CSS and the gazillion other specs.</p>

      <p>I try to keep up to date (and sometimes a bit in advance) with the tech of our industry by actively reading
        (and writing too!) the TC39 (ECMAScript), WHATWG (HTML), and W3C (CSS) githubs and mailing lists (ECMAScript).
        I love the open source community and <a href="https://github.com/Ephys">try to give back when I can</a>.</p>

      <p>
        I've worked with community-produced tech such as React, Webpack, SCSS, PostCSS, Babel, Gatsby, PHP, Wordpress,
        PostgreSQL, MySQL
        (others too but they're not as used anymore).

        <p>
          Pictawall was a SaaS platform that provided dynamic displays for User Generated Content to events and
          websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at Pictawall, I worked on implementing and optimizing the website integration of the
          platform.<br />
          It had to provide numerous different layouts and be highly flexible and configurable, while still loading
          extremely fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an extremely fun experience which allowed me to research and apply new techniques for optimization and
          modularization.
