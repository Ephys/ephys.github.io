					<h3>Hello there!</h3>

					<p>I'm <em>Guylian Cox</em>, a <span id="developer_age">20</span>-year-old currently studying Computer Science at
						<a href="http://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ipl/Pages/Informatique-de-gestion.aspx">Institut Paul-Lambin</a> in Brussels, currently in the final year. I'm mostly self-taught and, while classes are doing wonders at sharpening my algorithmic skills, my knowledge of web-related technologies comes primarily from online documentations such as the
						<abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDP</abbr> (and Stack Overflow).
					</p>

					<p>I've grown a passion for web development since I was 16, the constantly evolving field keeps me interested in finding out the newer tools that get available.</p>
					<p>Starting off with
						<em>PHP5</em> for a few years along with the mandatory web languages that are <em>HTML5</em>,
						<em>CSS3</em> and its preprocessors (<em>LESS</em> at first, followed by <em>SCSS</em>).
					    I then started learning <em>Javascript</em> and, with the advent of
						<em>NodeJS</em>, started getting more interested in the back-end than the front-end (although I still like the front-end).</p>

					<p>I tend to prefer stricter working environment, which is one of the reasons why I also like
						<em>Java</em> and would like to explore C# and .NET. Ruby and Python are also on my list.</p>

				<h3>ephys.github.io</h3>
				<p>Designed by <a href="http://morganebosmans.be">Morgane Bosmans</a> and integrated by myself.</p>
				<p>I like to rebuild it completely every now and then so the source code is most of the time up to date with newer knowledge I might have recently learned.</p>
				<p>There isn't much to say about it so I recreated the saints row 4 loading screen animation to distract you.</p>

				<h3>Cappuccino</h3>
				<p>Cappuccino was my Bac+2 year-end work; It's a desktop application written in Java.</p>
				<p>The project was developed in a team of 5 students. My part of the work was to manage the project and the team along with writing the core components of the application such as the dependency injection framework.</p>

				<h3>Tinkers' Steelworks</h3>
				<p>Tinkers' Steelworks is a
					<a href="http://minecraftforge.net">MinecraftForge</a> mod I forked mid-2014 when its original author, known as
					<a href="https://github.com/Toops/">toops</a>, stopped working on it. You can find the original version
					<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1445710-1-6-4-tinkers-steelworks">here</a>
				</p>

				<p>At first I picked it up to port it to Minecraft 1.7.10 but it quickly became a playground with which I put the Java concepts I was studying at my school into practice. My work on that project however, was mainly focused on fixing bugs, improving existing features and creating an API to support the interactions with other game modifications.<br> On a personal level this project helped me improved my understanding of Java, along with the discovery of gradle and maven.</p>

				<h3>Coraline</h3>
				<p>Coraline is an attempt at replacing <a href="http://www.claroline.net/">Claroline</a> with an application based not only on teachers' need but students' too.</p>
				<p>It is under development and it is written in NodeJS and uses angularJS. The development has been paused to work on school projects but will resume as soon as I can.</p>
				<p>I want to make the application completely modular, and I am most likely going to rewrite it completely because the current architecture doesn't match my needs anymore.</p>

				<h3>StupidCms</h3>
				<p>We were asked to build a website from scratch; I built a framework for the website. It isn't very efficient and shouldn't be used in anything serious but it was a interesting experience which helped me understand how similar frameworks could work.</p>
