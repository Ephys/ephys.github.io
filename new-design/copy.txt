      <p>Hi I'm <strong style="/*! font-weight: normal; *//*! color: #bf1f55; *//*! background: white; *//*! padding: 2px; *//*! color: #2b2782; */">Guylian</strong>
  !</p>

      <p>I'm a deeply <strong>passionate developer</strong> who continuously strives to be better at both who I am and what I'm
        doing.</p>

      <p>I strive to do my part in creating a <strong>fast</strong>, and <strong>accessible</strong> World Wide Web.
        I really enjoy finding new, automated, optimizations to make my apps faster.</p>

      <p>Currently, my language of predilection is <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I am also very enthusiast about other
        web technologies such as the DOM, HTML, CSS and the gazillion of other specs.</p>

      <p>I love discovering new technologies and keeping myself <strong>up to date</strong> with (and sometimes a bit ahead of) the tech of our industry by actively reading
        (and writing too!) the TC39 (ECMAScript), WHATWG (HTML), and W3C (CSS) githubs and mailing lists.
        I love the open source community and <a href="https://github.com/Ephys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try to give back when I can</a>.</p>

      <p>
  I've worked on and with community-produced tech such as <strong>React, Webpack, SCSS, PostCSS, Babel, Gatsby, PHP, Wordpress,
  PostgreSQL, MySQL</strong>
        (others too but they're not as used anymore).
